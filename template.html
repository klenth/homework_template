                    FILL IN: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT

                <p>
                    If you don't want a display of the total number of points for the assignment, delete the <code>&lt;div class="total points"&gt;</code> below.
                </p>
                <div class="total points"></div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="problems">
                <!--
                    Each problem should be one <div class="problem">...</div>
                    
                    - Inside the div, <ol class="parts">...</ol> will give an ordered list of parts (right now this just
                      means it uses a, b, c numbering instead of 1, 2, 3).
                      
                    - Use a div with the "points" class to show a number of points on the left side, e.g.
                      <div class="points">4</div>
                      for something that's worth 4 points.
                      
                    - If you include a <div class="total points"></div> inside the problem, it will add a display for
                      the problem's total points at the bottom. (You can put in a number of points yourself, or leave it
                      blank to have the JavaScript autocompute it by summing all the <div class="points">s.)
                      
                    If you want to omit the number (which will also cause it not to be listed in the sidebar) use the no-number class:
                    <div class="problem no-number">
                -->
                <div class="problem">
                    <div class="title auto-number"></div>
                    
                    <p>FILL IN: PROBLEM PROMPT</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a sample problem prompt. It has some subparts, each with its own number of points:</p>
                    
                    <ol class="parts">
                        <li>
                            <div class="points">8</div> This part is worth 8 points.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="points">4</div> This one is worth 4 points.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This one doesn't include points.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>The points display below is autocomputed from the points listed above. I could override this by putting something inside the <code>&lt;div class="total points"&gt;</code> tag.</p>
                    
                    <div class="total points"></div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="problem">
                    <div class="title auto-number"></div>
                    
                    <p>Here is another problem.</p>
                    
                    <ol class="parts">
                        <li>
                            <div class="points">1</div> Just one point!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="points">0</div> I suppose you could explicitly say something is worth 0 points &mdash; why not?
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="total points"></div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="problem">
                    <div class="title">Titled problem</div>
                    
                    <p>This problem has a title instead of a number.</p>
